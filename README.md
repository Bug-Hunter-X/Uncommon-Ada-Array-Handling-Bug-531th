This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to array handling in Ada.  The bug arises from the attempt to iterate through an array using its range and indirectly accessing the array through its range, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. The solution provides a corrected approach ensuring correct array access and demonstrates proper error handling.
